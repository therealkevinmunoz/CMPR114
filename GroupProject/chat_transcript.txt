You:What is python
ChatGPT:Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes code readability and simplicity. It was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Python is used for a wide range of applications, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. It is known for its minimalistic syntax and dynamic semantics, which make it easy to learn and use. Python code is interpreted at runtime, rather than being compiled in advance, making it an ideal choice for rapid prototyping and iterative development.
